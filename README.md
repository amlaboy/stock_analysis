# stock_analysis
## Project Overview
The goal of our analysis was intially check the performance of the ticker "DQ". After our analysis showed that the performance of that stock was unsatisfactory we proceded to do an analysis on all the provided tickers for the years 2017 and 2018. For each ticker we collect the total yearly volume, the open price and the close price. We took the open price and divided it by the closing price to get the yearly return. The macro displays a message box when ran to allow the user to choose which year they would like to run the analysis on.
